[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [4mScreen[24m  is  a  full-screen  window  manager  that multiplexes a physical terminal[m
       between several processes (typically interactive shells).  Each virtual  terminal[m
       provides  the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition, several control[m
       functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64) and ISO  2022  standards  (e.g.[m
       insert/delete  line and support for multiple character sets).  There is a scroll‐[m
       back history buffer for each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that[m
       allows moving text regions between windows.[m
[m
       When  [4mscreen[24m  is  called,  it  creates a single window with a shell in it (or the[m
       specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you can use the  program[m
       as  you normally would.  Then, at any time, you can create new (full-screen) win‐[m
       dows with other programs in them (including more shells), kill existing  windows,[m
       view  a  list  of  windows,  turn  output logging on and off, copy-and-paste text[m
       between windows, view the scrollback history, switch between windows in  whatever[m
       manner  you  wish,  etc. All windows run their programs completely independent of[m
       each other. Programs continue to run when their window is currently  not  visible[m
       and  even  when  the  whole  [4mscreen[24m session is detached from the user's terminal.[m
       When a program terminates, [4mscreen[24m (per default) kills the window  that  contained[m
       it.   If  this window was in the foreground, the display switches to the previous[m
       window; if none are left, [4mscreen[24m exits.[m
[m
       Everything you type is sent to the program running in the  current  window.   The[m
       only exception to this is the one keystroke that is used to initiate a command to[m
       the window manager.  By default, each command begins with a  control-a  (abbrevi‐[m
       ated C-a from now on), and is followed by one other keystroke.  The command char‐[m
       acter and all the key bindings can be fully customized to be anything  you  like,[m
       though they are always two characters in length.[m
[m
       [4mScreen[24m does not understand the prefix "C-" to mean control.  Please use the caret[m
       notation ("^A" instead of "C-a") as arguments to e.g. the [4mescape[24m command  or  the[m
       [4m-e[24m option.  [4mScreen[24m will also print out control characters in caret notation.[m
[m
       The  standard  way to create a new window is to type "C-a c".  This creates a new[m
       window running a shell and switches to that window immediately, regardless of the[m
       state  of the process running in the current window.  Similarly, you can create a[m
       new window with a custom command in it by first binding the  command  to  a  key‐[m
       stroke  (in your .screenrc file or at the "C-a :" command line) and then using it[m
       just like the "C-a c" command.  In addition, new windows can be created  by  run‐[m
       ning a command like:[m
